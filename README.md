# AsyncAwaitDemo-MVP-iOSWith-MVP
AsyncAwaitDemo-MVP-iOS is a showcase project that demonstrates the implementation of the async/await feature in UIKit using the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture pattern. This project aims to illustrate how to leverage the power of asynchronous programming in iOS applications while adhering to a clean and scalable architecture.


Features:

1. Async/Await: Learn how to use the new async/await syntax introduced in Swift to handle asynchronous operations elegantly and improve code readability.

2. MVP Architecture: Explore the Model-View-Presenter architectural pattern to achieve separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.

3. UIKit Integration: Discover how to integrate the async/await feature into UIKit components, including View Controllers, Views, and View Models.

4. Clean Code: Experience a well-organized and modular code structure that promotes code reusability and clarity.

5. Network Requests: Observe how async/await can streamline network requests and response handling, simplifying the process of dealing with asynchronous APIs.

6. Error Handling: Understand how async/await can make error handling more straightforward and intuitive, avoiding callback hell.

7. UI Updates: Witness smooth UI updates without blocking the main thread, leading to a more responsive user interface.

Getting Started:

Follow these steps to run the demo:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
   
2. Open the Xcode project AsyncAwaitDemo-MVP-iOS.xcodeproj.
   
3. install all pod by run command in terminal Go to ~> cd <project directory> ~> pod install
   
4. Build and run the project on your iOS simulator or device.
